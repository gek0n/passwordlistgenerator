-i
		Use this option if you want to substitute many words typed form keyboard or loaded from input stream.
		For example, if you type :PasswordListGenerator subs -i
		You will see folowing:
		Selected method is GoodLeet
		
		Now you can type any word or symbol and substitutions will appear in the console:
		<Q> (typed)
		Q
		(,)
		<B> (typed)
		B
		|3
		8
		<q> (typed)
		[ERROR]: The symbol "q" is not in the dictionary. Please specify other dictionary or use
		ignore-case option

		<Enter> (pressed)
		If you press <Enter> without type any symbols, application session will be interrupted.
		Note: If you use this option with "-o" option, then new substitutions will be append to the end
		of the specified file.

		You can also use this option with file in input stream:
		type inputFilename.txt | PasswordListGenerator subs -i

		ZB
		2B
		7_B
		Z|3
		Z8
		2|3
		28
		7_|3
		7_8
		C
		[
		{
		(
		<

		It's output for inputFilename.txt file, contains "ZB\\r\\nC"
		You can use "-o" option to save it output directly in out file or use
		">> outFilename.txt" to redirect application output (not recommended, because all supporting
		information will be included into the file)
